I'm a freelance technology journalist and researcher who has covered information security, cybercrime and technology's impact on society for two decades. I have written reports on cyber-threats, enterprise security and trends in the industry for a number of clients and covered cybercrime and security technology for almost two dozen publications, including Ars Technica, CNET, eWEEK, MIT Technology Review, SecurityFocus, Threatpost and ZDNet. I conservatively estimate that I've written more than 4,000 articles over my career.

While at ZDNet and CNET, I won three journalism awards, including -- along with Ina (n√©e Ian) Fried -- the prestigious [Sigma Delta Chi award from the Society of Professional Journalists in 2003](https://www.spj.org/sdxa03.asp#8) for our coverage of the Blaster worm and its impact. As a freelancer, I was designated a Top Cybersecurity Journalist in [2010](https://www.sans.org/top-journalists/2010) and [2014](http://www.sans.org/top-journalists/2014) by the SANS Institute.

In addition to continuing writing for various publications, I analyze data from and trends in the security industry and write reports based on my analysis.
