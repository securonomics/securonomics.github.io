This is my first post using Jekyll. Seems cool... perhaps a bit kludgy from a technical perspective. Or I guess barebones would describe it better. It would almost be nice if the `jekyll serve` command ran a Web-based CMS that used the file system as its output. 

I'm sure that this opinion is only because I'm not used to it. Because this allows me to use my current tools and not worry about logging into a CMS and learning their system. Instead, I'm learning ruby, HTML, and CSS, which I need to learn anyway.

So, overall -- 4 out of 5 at this point.

### Some technical notes
So, I had trouble getting this post to display and the reason was the date I put on the post.

I had put a future time in, thinking that I needed to because I put in the timezone offset, but it is not necessary.
